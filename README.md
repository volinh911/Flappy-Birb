# Flappy-Birb

MIDTERM PROJECT:
This is a remake of Flappy Bird called “FLAPPY BIRB” which is a course project for android application using Android Studio
- How to play: Basically, the player controls the “Birb”, which is the main character of the game. The player is tasked with navigating “Birb” through pairs of tubes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. “Birb” automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of tubes awards the player one point. Colliding with a tube ends the gameplay. Besides, there are some new features for this remake: 
  +	The player can customize the theme for this game by choosing background (day or night), “Birb” (red, yellow or green), tubes (green or red) 
  +	The difficulty of the game is significantly increased since the tubes now moves persistently from left to right, which is different from the original. This gameplay brings a new feeling to the player by making the player feel the birds are slowing down against the tubes.
